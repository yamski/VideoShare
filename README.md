# videoShare

Vio app gives user complete camera controls when recording their next experience.
Take control over poor lighting conditons and fine tune exporsure, ISO, color tint, color temperature, and white balance as you record.

Vio also accesses videos from the phone's library and allows you to properly organize videos by assigning them tags, or giving your video clips a title. Stop searching for your video by date recorded and by a preview of the first frame. Give your video the title "Sarah's first step at 10 months old!", or tag it with #sarah, #firstSteps, #10months. Search and find your videos efficiently.
